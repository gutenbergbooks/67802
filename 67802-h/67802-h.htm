<h3 class="nobreak">HOW READY LOST HIS HEAD</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was a little black and white dog with a
shaggy coat and a waggy tail. He had
very polite eyes which were always watching
people to find out what they would like to have
him do. Whenever people were kind enough to
tell him what they wanted, he would always
do it for them if he possibly could, and that
is why he was named “Ready.”</p>

<p>Ready loved his little master Dick more
than any one in the world, and Dick never
wanted Ready out of his sight; and that is how
this story came about.</p>

<p>It was a very sad day for Dick and Ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
when Dick fell from the apple tree and broke
his arm. Have you ever broken your arm? If
you have, you know how much it hurts, and how
still you have to be. Even then the pain won’t
go away. Of course Dick wanted Ready with
him every single minute of the day and night.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the second night
Ready felt that he really must stretch his legs
while Dick was asleep. He would not have
thought of letting his master know that he was
in great need of a little run, but now that Dick
was asleep&mdash;and he put his nose against Dick’s
good arm to be quite sure that he was&mdash;Ready
stepped out of the open window into the big
world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image003" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image003.png" width="400" height="523" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p>All would have gone well if Ready had not met
 Big Yellow Dog</p></div>

<p>I suppose all would have gone well if Ready
had not met Big Yellow Dog. Big Yellow Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
had always snubbed Ready frightfully, but even
Big Yellow Dogs have their good moments,
and this must have been one of them.</p>

<p>Big Yellow Dog said, “Good evening,” and
almost stopped.</p>

<p>This turned Ready’s head. It would have
turned any dog’s head. Did you ever have
your head turned? You will some day, and
when it happens, try hard to look where you
are going, for you are <i>always going wrong</i>.</p>

<p>Of course Ready did not know this, and
when Big Yellow Dog said pleasantly, “Come
along,” Ready went. Faster and faster ran
Big Yellow Dog. Faster and faster ran Ready,
although he felt that his legs were getting
shorter and shorter.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ready lost sight of Big Yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Dog altogether, and then he felt very tired.
He sat right down on the pavement, for he
knew now that his head had been turned. Of
course he tried to turn it back again, but he was
so tired that he only made it worse.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="figcenter" id="image005" style="width: 350px;">
  <img src="images/image005.png" width="400" height="338" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Faster and faster ran Ready</p></div></div>

<p>Then he tried to run home, but of course he
ran in the wrong direction, and when you run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
home in the wrong direction, a most unpleasant
thing happens&mdash;<i>you don’t get there at all</i>.</p>

<p>Ready ran on and on until he came to a house
which he thought was his. You see he was
quite sleepy by this time, and when you have a
sleepy turned head you may as well give up.</p>

<p>He wondered why the windows were all
closed, but even before he had finished saying,
“How queer that the windows are not&mdash;&mdash;” he
was fast asleep on the doormat. He did not
wake up until he heard some one talking.</p>

<p>“Oh, see this darling little dog!” said a young
lady, looking down at him.</p>

<p>Then all the family came to look down at him
and to say, “How cute!” and “What a dear!”</p>

<p>Now Ready, as you remember, was a very
polite little dog; so of course he wagged his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
waggy tail and said in his best dog language,
“How do you do?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image007" style="width: 325px;">
  <img src="images/image007.png" width="400" height="274" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“How do you do?”</p>
</div>

<p>This seemed to delight everybody, and they
gave him breakfast at once. Ready greatly enjoyed
his breakfast, and he thought there would
be no harm in staying a few minutes with such
very pleasant people. But that is where he
made his second bad mistake, as you will see.</p>

<p>He really should have run away from them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
fast as his little legs could carry him, for all at
once the young lady said, “I am going to keep
this little dog <i>forever</i>.”</p>

<p>“But you can see by his collar,” said her
mother, “that he belongs to some one else.”</p>

<p>I had forgotten to tell you that Ready wore a
nice little silver collar and on it was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“HIS NAME IS READY BECAUSE HE
ALWAYS IS SO.”</p>
</div>

<p>“It does not say <i>where</i> he belongs,” said the
young lady with a pout, “and I <i>want</i> him.”</p>

<p>“He will not want to stay,” said the mother.</p>

<p>“Then I will tie him up and <i>make</i> him stay,”
said the young lady, quite crossly.</p>

<p>Now any one could see with half an eye that
the young lady was going to have her own way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Even Ready felt that without understanding
young-lady language. If he had known what
dreadful things she was saying, of course he
would have run right out of the door.</p>

<p>But he did not know; so he only wagged his
tail, hoping that would make her feel a little
better. He thought that he must do something
in return for his good breakfast.</p>

<p>The young lady grew crosser and crosser and
finally stamped her foot. This made Ready
decide to leave at once, for there is no knowing
what may happen to dogs or dishes when any
one begins to stamp a foot!</p>

<p>Ready stood up and said his prettiest good-bye,
which was three little barks and then one
long one, with tail wagging all the time, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>In a second he would have been out of the
house, but the young lady caught him by the
collar and held him.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;I cannot tell you how it hurts me
to say this&mdash;<i>they tied him</i>. Yes, they did! They
tied him to an old hook and kept him there for
nearly a week! They took him out for a breath
of air for a few minutes each day and then put
him back in his stuffy prison.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course if Ready had been a dog of the
world, he might have found ways to
escape. He might have snapped at people or
howled all night. Then the father of the family
would surely have let him out, for fathers hate
to be disturbed at night.</p>

<p>But Ready had always been taught that snapping
and growling are very wicked; so he only
moaned a little and shed a few dog tears when
no one was looking. You see it is a disgrace
to a dog’s doghood to be found in tears.</p>

<p>Of course he was not the least bit hungry.
How could any dog be hungry shut up all day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in a stuffy old room? And then nothing takes
away a dog’s appetite so quickly as sad thoughts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image012" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image012.png" width="400" height="208" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Shed a few dog tears when no one was looking</p></div>

<p>At first he did not eat anything, and then he
began to have a very queer feeling in his legs.
They were such wobbly and uncertain legs that
they frightened Ready. He remembered going
once to a dog lecture where the speaker had
said:</p>

<p>“Fellow dogs, beware of unreliable legs!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
There is nothing left in life for a dog if his
legs go back on him.”</p>

<p>Ready remembered that this great dog doctor
had given him a number of prescriptions. This
was one of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>FOR RAPID RUNNING LEGS</p>

<p>Eat carefully, exercise regularly, and don’t ever be
cast down.</p>
</div>

<p>When Ready thought of these words, he began
to eat a little each day and to run around the
room for exercise after each meal. Then he tried
very hard to cast out his sad thoughts. He
would put himself to sleep saying over and over,
“I think to-morrow I will get out. To-morrow
I am going to be free.”</p>

<p>Whenever the young lady talked to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Ready tried in all kinds of ways to tell her that
he must get to his little master as soon as possible.</p>

<p>First he would lie down at her feet and look
up beseechingly in her eyes. After that he
would run to the door, wagging his tail all the
time. Then he would come back and beg. <i>Oh,
how hard he would beg her to let him go!</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image014" style="width: 225px;">
  <img src="images/image014.png" width="400" height="441" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“Please let me go back to my little master”</p></div>

<p>But she never once understood him&mdash;never
once noticed he was saying, “Oh, dear young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
lady, please let me go back to my little master.
He is very ill and needs me. Don’t you see that
I belong to him? I will do anything in the
world for you that an honorable little dog can
do, if you will <i>only let me go</i>.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the saddest of all his prison days was
the time he really thought she was going to release
him. He had wagged his tail especially
hard that morning at the door. She had put on
her hat saying, “Come on, then.”</p>

<p>Oh, how happy he was and how hard he tried
to thank her! Then came the dreadful minute
when she <i>fastened a silver chain to his collar</i>.</p>

<p>At first he broke down completely and moaned
and moaned. Then he thought: “Perhaps if I
walk by her side very nicely it will soften her
heart; and then there is always a chance when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
out in the great beautiful open world.”</p>

<p>So he walked quite contentedly by her side
and waited patiently while she stopped to chat
with some other young ladies. But when she
said boastingly, “Do you see my beautiful
new dog?” he simply could not stand it. Do you
know what he did? He growled, and his growl
had a bit of a snap in it, too. This made the
young lady very cross, and she decided to take
Ready home at once.</p>

<p>When they reached the door, Ready’s eyes
would have melted a heart of stone. He knelt
to her, he moaned to her, he begged so prettily
on his hind legs, but the young lady would
have none of it. She pushed him rudely into
the dark room and slammed the door.</p>

<p>I think that was the saddest moment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Ready’s prison life. But in spite of everything,
Ready never once gave up the hope of getting
his chance to escape, and that is why it came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened this way. One evening the
young lady and her mother had gone to one
of those long-lasting parties which do not begin
until nearly every one in the world has gone to
sleep. The maid was out too, probably to another
party. The fat old cook was so sleepy
that she forgot to fasten Ready to the hook and
cord after she had opened the window. Wasn’t
that lucky?</p>

<p>Ready pretended to be asleep until he heard
her slow step on the stairs. Then, quick as
a wink, he was out of the window and in the
yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>The shortest cut to the street was a dash
through the flower bed, and Ready started to
go that way. Then he remembered that really
nice dogs were always polite to flowers. Now
the only way a dog can be really polite to
flowers is to keep away from them; so Ready
turned and ran around the path.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image019" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/image019.png" width="400" height="396" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Quick as a wink he was out of the window</p></div>

<p>But in spite of this long way around, Ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
was soon on the main road. He must make
no mistake now. He must never let his head
get turned again. Which was the right direction?
The road looked so strange, so dark and
lonely, that it was hard for a dog to tell anything
about it.</p>

<p>Ready felt that he must not wait a moment;
so he started. But he soon heard an owl hooting
from a tree near by, “No, no, no!”</p>

<p>Then Ready turned and ran in the other
direction. From some very far-away place he
heard, “Quite right, Bob White,” and so he
knew that all was well. Now he would soon
come to his dear little master’s house.</p>

<p>On and on he ran, along the cool dark village
street, until suddenly he saw in the distance
the queer-shaped old oak tree that stood by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the gray church at the corner. Ready was
very happy, for he knew the way perfectly now.
Many a race had he taken to this place with
his Master Dick. Many a frolic they had had
together under that old tree.</p>

<p>It took about three minutes more of hard
dog running to bring him to the dear green
house. He noticed that it looked very dark
and lonely. Perhaps all the grown-ups had
gone to the party too. He gave three crisp
little joy barks which always meant to Master
Dick, “Ready’s here.”</p>

<p>There was no answer at all. So Ready, with
a heavy heart, decided to lie right down by the
door and wait until morning.</p>

<p>You may be sure that he woke up very early
indeed, in order to be up before Master Dick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
He gave his three joy barks again and again,
but no answer came.</p>

<p>Just then old Rover appeared. He was the
oldest dog about that part of the town, and he
knew everything.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image022" style="width: 325px;">
  <img src="images/image022.png" width="400" height="226" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Just then old Rover appeared</p></div>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he said to Ready. “They
have been looking everywhere for you, but
<i>now you are too late</i>!”</p>

<p>“Too late?” said Ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, too late,” said Rover severely. “The
little master was so sick that they took him to
the seashore yesterday.”</p>

<p>Then Ready was the saddest little dog in the
world, and he looked so.</p>

<p>“It’s your own fault,” said Rover. “Why
did you run away?”</p>

<p>At this Ready broke down altogether, tail
and all, and sobbed out the whole story.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said Rover at last, “be a dog
and keep up your courage. Try wagging your
tail a little, that always helps.”</p>

<p>So Ready wagged his tail and it did help a
little speck. Then Rover gave him some
breakfast and that helped a great deal.</p>

<p>After breakfast was over, Rover gave Ready
letters of introduction to several traveling dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
friends of his in the hope that they might happen
to know Master Dick’s seashore home.
But when night came a very tired and discouraged
little Ready returned to the lonely
house. You see, most of the traveling dogs
had already left the city and the others had
sent down word, “Too busy,” or “Not at home.”</p>

<p>It was the darkest hour of Ready’s life. Indeed,
I do not know what would have happened
next if a happy Robin had not been still awake,
singing, “Cheer up.” When he saw sad little
Ready, as quick as a wink he made this other
verse to his evening song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chance, chance, chance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Everybody has a chance;</div>

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Listening to Robin’s song of cheer</p></div>

<p>I cannot tell you how much this helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Ready. He wagged his tail at once and decided
he would take a little run in the moonlight,
so as to be on the lookout for chances.</p>

<p>As he ran along, he noticed a great many
dogs going by. Dogs he had never seen, dogs
old, dogs young, dogs middle-aged, all in a
great hurry. He asked several of them where
they were going, but few had time to answer
him.</p>

<p>One said, “Aren’t you going?” and several
mumbled something that he could not make out.</p>

<p>At last one very fat and panting dog stopped
to rest a minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t you please tell me where you are
going?” asked Ready.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you <i>know</i>?” was the answer.
“This is the 21st of June!”</p>

<p>Just then another dog came along. “Hurry
up, you two, or you’ll be late,” he called out.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the panting, fat dog.</p>

<p>Now Ready had had so much bad luck running
about with strange dogs that he only
shook his head and said, “I don’t know anything
about it.”</p>

<div class="section illowp100" id="image026" style="max-width: 123.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image026.png" alt="Illustration of dogs running" /><img class="w100" src="images/image026.png" alt="Continued illustration" />
</div>

<p>“Don’t know anything about it? By my tail,
you must be a stranger here,” said the panting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
fat one. Ready afterwards called him “Paf”
for short&mdash;“P” standing for panting and “F”
for fat, you see.</p>

<p>“At midnight on the 21st of June, if it is
moonlight, a wonderful thing happens. All
the beasts, birds and flowers in this part of the
world meet in an open space near the woods.
They have music, dancing and refreshments.
Then the Eagle, who is the king of the birds,
grants a wish to any animal who has a clear
record.</p>

<p>“The Eagle gives the wish to the beasts, instead
of the birds and flowers, because nobody
ever has anything against the flowers anyway,
and they don’t care for new experiences. As
for the birds, they have so many chances to
travel and do interesting things that His Majesty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the Eagle, decided to go outside of his own
family and give the wish to the four-footers.
You see, they get around very little as they have
no wings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image029" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image029.png" width="400" height="179" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“Come on,” said the panting, fat dog</p>
</div>

<p>“The animals are not what they once were,”
Paf went on, as they hurried along. “Last year
no one could get it, and the year before only
one had a chance even to try.”</p>

<p>“Do many want to try?” asked Ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Not so many as there were in my young
days,” said Paf. “It’s unpleasant being refused,
you see, and having all the little things
you have done and forgotten thrown in your
face. I’d try myself to-night, but I had a bad
time a few days ago with an old alley cat. It
was all her fault of course, but I know she will
be here to-night to complain of me if I should
come forward.</p>

<p>“It is hard, these days,” Paf went on, “to
get a clear record, since they allow all kinds
of cats to vote, and even flowering vines and
chickens can speak against us. So what is an
animal to do? It used to be that an English
sparrow’s vote counted nothing, but now these
worthless creatures have as much to say as we
do. Why, no cat has a chance because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
mice are all invited. Times are sadly changed.”
And poor Paf sighed.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At last</span> they reached the place, and
it was a wonderful sight. All the four-footed
animals sat on the ground in front.
The birds were perched on the trees, and the
flowers massed themselves around the Eagle’s
throne.</p>

<p>Suddenly the birds all began to sing a beautiful
song, and the flowers commenced to dance
a soft swaying dance. Then the thrushes sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>At this the flowers bowed their heads, the
beasts all knelt, and the birds flew out to meet
His Royal Majesty, the Eagle. Then the
birds made themselves into two lines and the
great Eagle flew between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>He was a savage-looking bird indeed. He
wore for the occasion a large crown of red
feathers, and carried in one of his claws an
enormous stick covered with rabbit’s fur, which
had five large dog teeth at the end of it.</p>

<p>Everything and everybody clapped and bowed
and cheered. Dogs wagged tails, chickens
cackled, roosters crowed, birds sang, and flowers
waved themselves.</p>

<p>The Eagle looked about fiercely, bowed slightly,
and seated himself on his throne, which was
on a little hill.</p>

<p>The entertainment began with a duet given
by a wood thrush and a song sparrow. It was
very pretty indeed. This was followed by a
Virginia Reel given by the daisies and buttercups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The orchestra was made up of thrushes, whippoorwills
and woodpeckers</p>
</div>

<p>Then the Eagle rapped loudly with his terrible
rod and said, “Every one may dance.”
And every one did.</p>

<p>The orchestra was made up of thrushes,
whippoorwills and woodpeckers. The woodpeckers
beat time on the bark of the trees.
Sometimes the robins and song sparrows joined.
It all sounded very well indeed until some blue
jays and roosters started in. Then an old crow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
commenced keeping time with his “caw, caw,
caw.”</p>

<p>This was too much for the Eagle, who
beat angrily on the oak tree with his rod and
stopped the dance immediately. “Too much
like a jazz band,” he shrieked. “We want
real music here. Jays, roosters and crows be
silent, or leave the dance hall. No cackling
and cawing in my orchestra while I am King
of Birds.”</p>

<p>You should have seen the dancing. The
flowers kept pretty much to themselves and
almost always waltzed.</p>

<p>The birds danced a two-step, flapping their
wings to beat time and splitting their dances
for a bit of a fly now and then.</p>

<p>Most of the four-footers “toddled.” Some did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the old-time polka, because it used all of their
legs evenly, beating four time, you see.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image038" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image038.png" width="400" height="205" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The birds danced a two-step</p>
</div>

<p>Ready saw that Paf wanted dreadfully to
dance and was without a partner, so he asked
him. They managed somehow to get about.
In fact, many thought Paf’s quite awkward out-of-time
step was something new, and several
young chickens tried to copy it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Then the Eagle raised his rod, and immediately
the dancing and music stopped.</p>

<p>“Refreshments are coming next,” whispered
Paf breathlessly.</p>

<p>Ready was glad to hear this, as he had had
nothing to eat since breakfast, but Paf was
mistaken this time. When all was quiet the
Eagle said fiercely:</p>

<p>“Four-footers asking for wishes will now
come forward. We may as well get this part
of the program over at once, for from what
I hear of the beasts this year, it will take a very
short time.”</p>

<p>Then he tapped his rod three times and said,
“Ready!”</p>

<p>Little Ready started to his feet. This was
certainly his great chance, but he wished, oh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
so much, that refreshments had come first, as
his knees were weak from hunger and from
pulling around Paf.</p>

<p>A rather handsome black dog arose and a
large white cat. There was a terrible silence as
they walked slowly around the Eagle’s throne.
All eyes were turned upon them. The near-sighted
ones put on glasses which they had
brought for the occasion. The white cat, being
the only lady of the party, was called first to
the throne.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image040" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image040.png" width="400" height="150" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">She had eaten their father, mother, and aunt all in one day</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>After asking her name, age, address and telephone
number, the Eagle said, “This cat is before
you. Has any one anything against her?”</p>

<p>Immediately a dozen English sparrows flew
down to the throne and told a dreadful tale
about her. They said that she had caught and
eaten their mother, father and aunt all in one
day.</p>

<p>A grape vine also bent forward with leaves
outstretched, but the Eagle waved it back,
saying in a terrible voice: “We have had evidence
enough. White Cat, withdraw.” And
White Cat scudded away.</p>

<p>Then the Eagle called the black dog, but an
old hen stepped up at once and indignantly
said, “Black Dog killed my fluffiest child when
she was scarcely out of the shell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>At this the Eagle took his rod and struck
the black dog, saying in his great and dreadful
voice, “How did you <i>dare</i> to come before me?”</p>

<p>Of course that was the end of the black dog,
who ran away with his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>Then Ready knew that his time had come.
If only his little legs would not give out! When
the Eagle said sternly, “Next”, he arose and
stood before him.</p>

<p>“Your name,” said the Eagle, pointing the
dreadful rod directly at him.</p>

<p>“Ready,” he answered huskily.</p>

<p>Then he heard the blue jays laughing and
the mocking birds saying “Ready” quite scornfully.</p>

<p>“Of course you are ready if you are ever
going to be,” shrieked the Eagle. “Give your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
name at <i>once</i>, or withdraw immediately.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image043" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“But my name <i>is</i> Ready. You can see it on my collar.”</p>
</div>

<p>“But my name <i>is</i> Ready. You can see it on
my collar,” said Ready, and the excitement
made his legs feel stronger.</p>

<p>“Look at his collar,” commanded the Eagle,
and everyone did.</p>

<p>“It is true, Your Royal Highness,” said the
Owl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” said the Eagle.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” said all the animals, one
after the other, and even the hens cackled,
“extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“Your age,” said the Eagle.</p>

<p>“Eleven months, Your Majesty,” Ready answered
bravely.</p>

<p>But when it came to address and telephone
number, Ready gathered up all his courage and
plunged at once into his sad little story.</p>

<p>Everyone was much interested. Several times
the Eagle leaned forward and said, “Louder.”
Then all the hens cackled, “Louder.”</p>

<p>Ready was much excited, though it hurt his
throat to pitch his voice so high. You see he
was not at all used to public speaking.</p>

<p>However, if you had been there, you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
have known that he was making a good impression.
It was noticed by many of the animals that
the Eagle once put his handkerchief to his eyes.</p>

<p>There was a great silence when Ready finished
speaking. Then the Eagle rose upon
his throne, flapped his wings, and spoke in a
strangely gentle voice.</p>

<p>He said, “<i>The wish of this dog shall be
granted at once.</i>”</p>

<p>Everybody cheered wildly.</p>

<p>But the Owl, standing up and bowing low to
the Eagle, said, “Your Majesty, I beg of you
not to allow your feelings to carry you too far.
Remember the rules of our great gathering
here. Let us see if any one has anything against
this animal.”</p>

<p>Now the Eagle had always a great respect for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the Owl. Indeed, the time he had been obliged
to go to Washington to have his picture taken
for the new American dollar, the owl had taken
his place at this meeting. So the Eagle said:
“Very well, Ready is before you. Who speaks
against him?”</p>

<p>It was very still for a minute. Ready’s heart
beat fast as he feared he might have offended a
chicken, a cat or something without knowing
it, but no one answered and the cheering began.</p>

<p>Then again the Owl stepped forward. “I
hate to seem so particular,” he apologized, “but
I have just been re-reading the rules of our
great gathering. It says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All animals who are strangers in the neighborhood
must be properly introduced and vouched for before
any wishes can be granted them.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Ready was introduced by Paf, but he
must be vouched for by some one else. By that
I mean,” explained the Owl, “that some one
must speak a good word for him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image047" style="width: 180px;">
  <img src="images/image047.png" width="200" height="270" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“I will speak for him”</p>
</div>

<p>At this Ready’s heart sank. Who indeed
would speak for him? Who knew him here?
Then he heard a voice saying, “I will speak for
him. When he jumped out of the window the
other night, he was in a great hurry. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
shortest way would have been to step upon my
lame shoulder, but he went the long way instead.”</p>

<p>Now Ready knew that the largest geranium
in the flower bed was speaking.</p>

<p>“I am an old flower,” she continued, “but it
is the first time a dog has shown me any consideration.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” said the Eagle, waving his rod,
“when he had so much provocation, too.”</p>

<p>“So much provocation,” sang the birds.</p>

<p>“Much provocation,” crowed the roosters,
and cackled the hens.</p>

<p>“Much provocation,” barked the dogs.</p>

<p>Ready wondered what the large word meant,
but felt it must be a friendly word because the
Eagle looked so kindly at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Enough,” commanded the King of Birds.
“Ready, state your wish.”</p>

<p>By this time Ready’s legs had grown very
weak. For one minute he felt that he must say,
“I wish for food.” Then he remembered that
this was his one great chance to get back to his
Master Dick.</p>

<p>“I want to find my Master Dick’s seashore
home,” he said in quite a loud voice.</p>

<p>Then his little legs gave right out and he fell
fainting at the Eagle’s feet!</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Ready opened his eyes, he found
himself in the loveliest little bed in the
world. The animals by digging, gnawing,
and scratching had made a large hollow place
in the ground, and the birds had lined it with
feathers. Even the flowers had given some of
their leaves for the pillow.</p>

<p>You have no idea how comfortable it was.
The Eagle’s trained nurse was giving Ready
a teaspoonful of medicine every other minute.
A special dog doctor was taking his pulse, and
hundreds of birds were standing by waiting for
orders. Ready really felt very comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image051" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/image051.png" width="500" height="635" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A special dog doctor was taking his pulse</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“He is better,” said the dog doctor, “but not
yet on his feet.” Of course that was quite true,
was it not?</p>

<p>“Is there anything you would like?” asked
the trained nurse.</p>

<p>Ready raised his head and said anxiously,
“May I still have my first wish granted, if I
ask for anything else?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the Eagle.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said all the others.</p>

<p>“I very much want something to eat,” said
Ready, falling back upon the pillows.</p>

<p>Such a commotion as there was then! Twenty
blue-birds at once brought in a tray of liver.
A course of bones followed, and a large dish of
milk was served for dessert. Ready was a very
happy dog indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Then the Eagle said, “We will all have recess
and refreshments.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image053" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image053.png" width="400" height="122" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Twenty blue birds brought in a tray of liver</p>
</div>

<p>Now there was much moving about, eating,
and talking. Every one came up to Ready and
spoke to him. Many begged him to make
week-end visits. Some asked him to house
parties, and all the young dogs wanted his
photograph.</p>

<p>At last the Eagle raised his rod and every
one came to order. “We will now,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
in a businesslike manner, “try to find Master
Dick’s home at the seashore.”</p>

<p>Ready then told him all he knew about it,
which, of course, was very little. It was a red
house near the sea with a pine tree in front of it.</p>

<p>“That is quite enough,” said the Eagle, “I
will send out my messengers to find it.”</p>

<p>The Eagle now called together his trusty
messengers. There were five of them. A Blue
Heron for watchfulness; a Crow for good
judgment; a Swift for rapid flight; a Night
Hawk for keen eyesight; and a little Sparrow
for running the errands.</p>

<p>The Eagle talked to them all in a low tone for
a few minutes, giving them directions and
money for the journey.</p>

<p>Then the dance began, and who do you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
was Ready’s partner this time? Why, the Eagle
of course! It is a splendid thing to dance with
the King of Birds, and a rare thing for a dog.</p>

<p>It seemed to be dog night, for the Owl, who
had not danced for years, stepped out with a
dog. The Owl knew only one dance, an old-fashioned
hop waltz. The dog knew no dance
at all. He jostled about on his hind legs.</p>

<p>They really looked so ridiculous that some
gay young cat-birds laughed aloud, and called
out, “Toddle, toddle, don’t just waddle.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image055" style="width: 400px;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">They were immediately cuffed by their elders</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>They were immediately cuffed by their elders
for such bad manners, and made to sit out a
whole dance in the dressing room, which was
curtained off from the rest of the place by a row
of young pine trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image056" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/image056.png" width="400" height="226" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Telegram for the Eagle</p>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the dance was interrupted by the
entrance of the young Sparrow, who had returned
with a telegram for the Eagle.</p>

<p>Everything stopped at once and the Eagle’s
grandson immediately flew to the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
great oak tree, where his honored grandfather’s
spectacles had been placed in an oriole’s nest
for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>He returned in twenty seconds and found
everybody waiting breathlessly.</p>

<p>The Eagle looked troubled after he had read
the telegram. Then he and the Owl whispered
silently together.</p>

<p>“Bad news,” cawed the crows.</p>

<p>“Bad news,” shrieked the blue jays.</p>

<p>“Bad news,” squeaked the field mice.</p>

<p>The noise was terrific, and the Eagle waved
his rod angrily, crying, “Silence!”</p>

<p>“We are having trouble with the moths, butterflies
and bats,” he continued sternly, hitting
at a restless young pullet.</p>

<p>“You remember, that once we asked them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
join our gathering, but the bats behaved so
badly by bumping into everything that it broke
up the dancing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image058" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image058.png" width="400" height="145" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“Bad news,” cawed the crows and shrieked the blue jays</p>
</div>

<p>“The moths also were too silly for words.
They almost stopped the orchestra by hitting
them all the time. As for the butterflies, they
went to bed as usual without even taking the
trouble to send regrets.”</p>

<p>“Shameful, shameful!” hissed everybody.</p>

<p>“And so,” continued the Eagle, “we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
never given them another invitation.”</p>

<p>“Why should we?” sang a king bird shrilly.</p>

<p>“Why should we?” squeaked and piped,
barked and crowed, chirped and croaked, the
whole company.</p>

<p>“But,” the Eagle went on, waving his rod for
silence, “the bats did not like being left out, and
now they refuse to carry my messages over their
telegraph wires. They have formed a union
against us, and I can get nothing through to the
Sandpiper because it is over a wire which they
control. The telegram reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“REFUSE TO SEND SANDPIPER MESSAGE
UNLESS ADMITTED TO MEETING <a name="edit1" id="edit1"><ins title="Original has “TONIGHT”">TO-NIGHT</ins></a>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Of course no one understood a word of this
message except the Owl, who kept a Book of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Knowledge in his nest and always brought it
with him in case it should be needed. He now
explained that the message meant that they
would not be able to get Ready back to Master
Dick unless the moths and bats were allowed
to come to the meeting that night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image060" style="width: 300px;">
  <img src="images/image060.png" width="400" height="288" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Owl kept a Book of Knowledge</p>
</div>

<p>He also explained that this telegram had been
written by the oldest Bat in the world, who, for
several years, had made his home in the attic of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
one of the offices of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. That is where he had learned
all the big words to put in telegrams, and also
that no self-respecting telegram could have
more than ten words in it.</p>

<p>The Owl explained this very clearly to everyone.
He even pointed out the words in the
telegram and they all counted them aloud: “1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I think there is but one thing
to do,” said the Owl at last in a firm voice, “and
that is to grant them admittance to-night.”</p>

<p>“We will put it to a vote,” said the Eagle,
stepping up to his throne and rapping loudly
for order. Then he shouted, “All in favor of
getting Ready home by admitting these bats,
moths and butterflies, say ‘Aye.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Aye,” shouted everybody and everything.</p>

<p>Ready felt that he ought not to vote on such
a delicate matter, but he could not help wagging
his tail.</p>

<p>“Contrary ‘No,’” shrieked the Eagle.</p>

<p>Silence from everybody, for they were quite
used to public meetings now, and the wiser
birds and beasts always watched the foolish ones
and cuffed them if they made a sound.</p>

<p>“The motion is carried,” said the Eagle. “The
Owl will now send a telegram to admit them.
The message will reach the Sandpiper and all
will be right in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>The Owl, being a wise old bird, had the telegram
prepared beforehand. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>ACCEPT TERMS. SEND MESSAGE TO SANDPIPER
AND COME AT ONCE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>If you will count, you will see that this telegram
has exactly ten words. Wasn’t that very
clever of the Owl?</p>

<p>The ten minutes passed very quickly, as everybody
was talking in little groups about telegrams.
Many tried to write them. You could
hear a group of young crows counting the
words, “Caw, caw, caw.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image063" style="width: 350px;">

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The oldest Bat in the world appeared</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly, without a word of warning, the
oldest Bat in the world appeared with four or
five foolish moth millers. Of course no butterflies
came.</p>

<p>The Bat flew immediately toward the Eagle
and almost knocked off his glasses. Then, after
running into the Owl, he batted about the dance
hall. The millers followed, trying hard to
imitate him.</p>

<p>The Bat next sat for a few moments on a
rooster’s back and then hit a swallow who was
flying across the floor. Finally, without a word
of good-bye he was off again, with the millers
flopping feebly after him.</p>

<p>Everybody was much relieved to have it all
over. Indeed, most of the lady birds and beasts
had been so frightened that they put their handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
over their heads.</p>

<p>The warblers started a song at once and soon
everybody joined in.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Eagle almost smiled as he announced:
“Now the plans are made for Ready’s departure.”
He did not even need to rap for silence,
for everybody was so interested.</p>

<p>“My trusty messengers have just telephoned
me that everything is all right,” the Eagle continued.
“They have stopped for refreshments
and rest at the Night Hawk’s house and will
return shortly.</p>

<p>“You must start at once with the Chipmunks,”
he said, looking most kindly at Ready, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
came and knelt before him. “Good running
will bring you to the end of the woods by dawn.
I have telegraphed ahead to have your breakfast
waiting for you under the last oak tree in the
woods.</p>

<p>“It is to be guarded by the Red Headed
Woodpecker, who has kindly consented to give
his services. Rest here a half hour, but no
longer.</p>

<p>“Then the Swallows will show you the way
to the beach. They have promised to fly low so
that you will not lose them.</p>

<p>“About noon, you will meet a Field Mouse.
If she says, ‘Ready,’ you will follow her to a
place where your dinner will be hidden. There
you will meet the Sandpiper, who will take you
along the beach until you come to an inlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“You must go the rest of the way alone, as
the Heron, who was to take you, has appendicitis.
The road, however is straight ahead
and will take you to your master’s home.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">The Chipmunks were putting on their overcoats</p>

<p>Ready bowed low before the Eagle, barking
his thanks again and again, while the Chipmunks
were putting on their overcoats for the
journey.</p>

<p>Some one called out “Speech, speech,” but
the Eagle put a stop to that by saying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Ready needed to save his strength for the journey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image068" style="width: 375px;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">An old Frog gave Ready the queerest thing</p>

<p>Just then an old Frog hopped up and gave
Ready the queerest thing. You could never
guess what it was&mdash;<i>a hot-water bag</i>!</p>

<p>She said in a croaking voice, “I have never
really been warm in my life, but a hot water
bag has been a great comfort to me, and has
kept me next door to warm.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for Ready to do without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
hurting this old Frog’s feelings, but to accept
the bag with thanks. Yet he wondered how he
could ever carry such an awkward thing. However,
the trained nurse kindly fastened it to his
collar and then he started off with the Chipmunks.</p>

<p>They heard the animals cheering and calling
“Good luck to Ready!” long after they were
out of sight.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">WITH THE CHIPMUNKS</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> a little hard to follow the Chipmunks
at first, as they were so very much
smaller and could of course run like lightning
along the woody road. However, they would
always stop and wait for Ready very politely,
and several times when they found some nuts
under a hickory tree he had to wait for them.</p>

<p>Everything went on pretty well until they
reached a funny little cabin in the wood. Here
a dark little creature jumped off the roof and
whispered “Peanut Butter!” Then he was off
again as quick as a wink.</p>

<p>“Peanut Butter! Peanut Butter!” chattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
all the Chipmunks, and ran after the darting
little figure. Up they jumped on the roof and
in a moment were out of sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image071" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image071.png" width="400" height="142" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">He knew that chipmunks love peanut butter</p>
</div>

<p>What was poor little Ready to do? This
delay might upset all his plans. Perhaps they
would forget to come back altogether. He
knew that Chipmunks love peanut butter, because
he had heard a Chipmunk that very
evening boasting between dances of stealing
into a Boy Scout’s tent and prying open the
lid of a peanut butter jar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Ready thought and thought, and finally decided
to go around to the cabin door and give
quite politely three little barks. They would
mean, of course, “Ready, Ready, Ready.”</p>

<p>At first there was no answer to his call. Then
he barked again a little louder. This time he
said, “Please, <i>please</i>, come.”</p>

<p>At this, somebody in the house jumped out of
bed, and stamping to the window called out,
“Get away, little beast of a dog!”</p>

<p>Then Ready heard the peanut butter can fall
to the floor with a bang; and suddenly out ran
the Chipmunks, their coats flying behind them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image73" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/frontis.png" width="400" height="159" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Out ran the chipmunks</p>
</div>

<p>So fast did they run that they did not see
Ready at all until they were about one hundred
yards away from the house. As soon as
they really came to themselves and saw Ready,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
they cocked their little heads on one side and
pointed their paws towards a little figure vanishing
in the distance.</p>

<p>“He made us do it,” they chattered.</p>

<p>“It was only a few minutes,” one of them
apologized.</p>

<p>“You needed a little rest,” another remarked.</p>

<p>Ready did feel a little put out by the delay,
but he remembered that after all they had offered
to be his escorts and had only lost their heads
for a few minutes. Had not he too once lost
his head?</p>

<p>So he only wagged politely when he might
have said, “If it were not for my barking, you
would still be eating that peanut butter.”</p>

<p>Then they all started on again. To tell the
truth, the Chipmunks really felt ashamed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
themselves and thought that Ready was behaving
splendidly. You would know this by the
little things they tried to do for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image075" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image075.png" width="400" height="224" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“He made us do it,” they chattered</p>
</div>

<p>Chippy, the oldest, actually kept waiting for
him and once admired the spots on his coat.
Snippy, the youngest, offered to show him a
place where they all had some nuts stored for
winter. Of course that was a foolish offer to
make to a dog, but Ready knew it was meant
to be a great attention, so he said at once, “I
thank you very much, but think I will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
stop <a name="edit2" id="edit2"><ins title="Original has “tonight”">to-night</ins></a>, as it is growing quite late.”</p>

<p>They were getting near the end of the woods
now and all was going beautifully when a sudden
flash of lightning was followed quickly
by a clap of thunder. Then came a downpour
of rain, drenching everybody in about
two seconds.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but take refuge
in a hollow log near by. That is to say, the
Chipmunks went in, while Ready curled up
under a rhododendron bush which kindly acted
as an umbrella.</p>

<p>At first the Chipmunks seemed to fuss a good
deal, and complain about being crowded.
Ready remembered how much they loved to
chatter, so he barked, “Speech, speech, everyone
make a speech!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>These words acted like magic. Such a jabbering
never before was heard from a hollow
log.</p>

<p>Chippy recited a poem he had written about
himself. Snippy told of an adventure he had
had with a gray squirrel, and as for Clippy, he
just squeaked and thrashed around, saying,
“Here, here, nuts, nuts!”</p>

<p>It was all rather mixed up as you can guess,
and sounded something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am great big Chippy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My brother’s name is Snippy.”</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>
<p>By this time the rain had stopped and a tiny
streak of light was coming in the East. The
Chipmunks suddenly ceased chattering. Ready
pricked up his ears. Everything in the world
was very still. Far, far away in the distance
you could hear the birds beginning to wake up.</p>

<p>“Dawn is coming,” whispered Chippy, “and
we are not yet out of the woods.”</p>

<p>Without another word they were all scampering
along the road. Ready had never gone
so fast in his life. On and on they went. It
was a race with the coming dawn.</p>

<p>Five minutes of wonderful animal running
brought Ready to the edge of the wood, and
just as they reached the last oak tree, the
beautiful rose-colored light had come behind

<p>Ready whispered a “thank you” to the Chipmunks,
and an invitation to visit him for a
week-end as soon as he found his master’s
home. The Chipmunks put their little heads to
one side and then curtsied. They are really
quite polite little creatures when they remember
to be.</p>

<p>They were gone before you could say “Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Robinson,” and Ready was left alone, waiting
for his breakfast under the last oak tree in the
forest.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE JOURNEY WITH THE SWALLOWS</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ready</span> had scarcely been there a moment
before a Red Headed Woodpecker came
out of his hole and rather sleepily rang a breakfast
bell.</p>

<p>It sounded like this: “Punk, penk, pink,”
and it meant, “Come to breakfast.”</p>

<p>Ready answered at once with three of his
most cheerful barks, “Ready, ready, ready.”</p>

<p>Then the Woodpecker saluted him and flew
down to a little mound covered with fresh
leaves. Under this was a delicious dog breakfast.</p>

<p>After a pleasant little chat, the Woodpecker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
told Ready that he would have time for a fifteen
minute nap, and promised to call him. You
remember the Eagle had told him that he might
be able to manage a half hour’s rest at this
place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image082" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image082.png" width="400" height="132" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A Red Headed Woodpecker rang the breakfast bell</p>
</div>

<p>So after his good breakfast, Ready was very
glad to stretch himself out on the ground. He
was sound asleep in three seconds and oh, how
he did hate to get up when the Woodpecker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
first tapped! He was very tired and his feet
ached dreadfully, but after the third “punk,
penk, pink,” Ready remembered what it was
all about and was on his feet at once.</p>

<p>“The Swallows should be here by this time,”
said the Woodpecker, in a troubled voice. “I
think I must telephone to find out what is the
matter.”</p>

<p>After he had hung up the receiver, which was
hidden in a curled-up oak leaf, the Woodpecker
said: “Bad news, indeed. One of the mother
swallows has a frightful pain and cannot be
left alone.”</p>

<p>Then Ready knew why he had carried the
Frog’s hot-water bag all this time. He had
wanted very much to drop it on the way as it
had been so warm and heavy. Moreover, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
large bats had called out as he passed, “What is
it? What is it?”</p>

<p>He now went at once to Mother Swallow’s
house, which was in the hollow of a tree near by,
and put the hot-water bag on her pain. You
have no idea of the relief it gave her. Wasn’t it
good that Ready had not thrown it away?</p>

<p>Mother Swallow was then quite willing to
have Father Swallow and the children go on
with Ready. Even Fluffy Forked Tail, the
youngest in the family, went along.</p>

<p>Ready and the Swallows soon made up for
lost time. The Swallows were very polite, always
waiting for Ready and flying low to show
him the way.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going very well indeed,
and Ready’s heart was full of hope. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
sun was getting higher and higher and he knew
that it would soon be noon.</p>

<p>The Swallows had stopped a few minutes to
rest on a telephone wire and Ready was panting
a little on the ground below, when suddenly
a splash was heard in a pond near by. This was
followed by a great sputtering and twittering
and a call for help. Father Swallow looked
quickly about and saw that his youngest child
was missing.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I ever let him come?” moaned
Father Swallow, as he flew to the rescue. “He
has only just learned to fly, and I fear his wings
have given out.”</p>

<p>In a moment they were all around the pond,
and sure enough, there was Fluffy Forked Tail
in the water. Fortunately he had managed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
climb up on a big lily leaf, or he would have
been drowned before any help arrived.</p>

<p>Ready swam in at once and let poor Fluffy
get on his back. In a few moments both were
safe on the shore, with all the other swallows
twittering about them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image086" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image086.png" width="400" height="453" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Ready swam in and let poor Fluffy get on his back</p>
</div>

<p>There was a family consultation at once, and
then Father Swallow said to Ready: “My child
is suffering from nervous exhaustion, and I fear
we must consult a physician at once. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
heard that there is a good doctor among the
Barn Swallows about half a mile from here. I
am sending my two oldest sons over there to try
to find him. The other two children are making
a bed for poor little Fluffy, and I must
stay by his side and fan him until the doctor
comes.</p>

<p>“This is a most unfortunate delay for you,
Ready, but I fear that it would be impossible for
you to find your way alone.”</p>

<p>Ready felt very much disheartened, for this
delay might spoil everything. The Field Mouse
might grow tired of waiting. The Sandpiper
might fly home again, and then how could he
ever get to his dear master’s home? Indeed, he
almost broke down, so great was his disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>But as he looked into Father Swallow’s worried
and anxious face, he decided that he was
quite selfish to be so full of his own affairs. He
arose, and pulling himself together said, “Surely,
there must be something that I can do to help.”</p>

<p>Indeed, there was much to do, and Ready
soon found his heart getting lighter as he helped
the Swallows carry feathers and twigs to make
the little bed by the pond.</p>

<p>Of course, this carrying of twigs and feathers
was not a dog’s work, and once a little Spaniel,
from a field near by, barked “Baby! Baby!” It
was hard indeed not to run after him and give
him a good whipping, but this time Ready kept
his head by saying to himself in a low tone, over
and over again:</p>

<p>“My Master Dick is waiting, waiting, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
dear, dear Master Dick.” This helped wonderfully.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the little bed was made. It
was a lovely soft one, beautifully lined with
feathers brought from a chicken yard near by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image089" style="width: 175px;">

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Dr. Barn Swallow</p>
</div>

<p>Fluffy Forked Tail felt better immediately,
and when two of the swallows, who had been
watching on the telephone wire, twittered excitedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“They are coming!” he roused himself
and chirped “Good, good!”</p>

<p>Dr. Barn Swallow, who looked very handsome
in his beautiful buff vest, turned out to be
a very good physician. He took Fluffy’s pulse
and gave him a tablet at once. Then he said, “He
will be better in a few hours, but must have a
good sleep now. After that he must go home
and remain in bed the rest of the day.”</p>

<p>Ready’s heart sank at these words, but he
again pulled himself together.</p>

<p>Father Swallow told the doctor about Ready,
and the doctor listened with great interest, saying,
every now and then, “Certainly,” and “Of
course.”</p>

<p>When Father Swallow had finished, the Doctor
threw away the cigar he had been smoking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and was silent for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>“I think it will be quite safe for you to go
on with Ready and leave the children here to
take care of the patient. He must sleep, anyway,
and only needs some one about to see that
he is not disturbed. You will be back in time to
take him home.”</p>

<p>Oh, how Ready loved Dr. Barn Swallow for
those words! Even to this day he never passes
a barn swallow without saluting most politely
and asking if he can be of any service.</p>

<p>And so it was all settled. Soon the good-byes
and thank-yous were said, the Doctor’s fee was
paid, and Ready and Father Swallow were
speeding along the meadow road.</p>

<p>Ready was afraid that it was too late for the
Field Mouse to appear. He felt that it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
be long past noon. So he was greatly excited
when he saw one scudding along the road, and
was about to run after it and say, “I am Ready.
Are you waiting for me?”</p>

<p>But Father Swallow laid a detaining wing on
his shoulder, saying, “The Eagle’s directions
are to wait until the Field Mouse says ‘Ready.’
There are some bad little fellows about here
that might lead you astray and then pick your
pockets.”</p>

<p>So Ready had to content himself with going
quietly along, but his eyes were eagerly watching
both sides of the road. Several field mice
passed him and stared quite rudely, but none of
them said a word to him.</p>

<p>Just as they came to a turn in the road, Ready
stopped short, for there, lying under a toad-stool,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
was a Field Mouse, fast asleep. Ready gave a
tiny bark. At least he thought there would be
no harm in that. The Field Mouse awakened
immediately, blinked, and then squeaked:
“Ready?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image093" style="width: 350px;">

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">There, lying under a toad-stool, was a Field Mouse,

</div>

<p>Oh, how happy our little dog felt! His heart
grew so light that he did not feel it at all.
Father Swallow patted him on the back and
said “Good-bye” at once, promising to send him
a postal as soon as his son was better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The Field Mouse apologized for having
fallen asleep, and guided Ready to a dinner of
nice meaty bones in an old pan near a barn.</p>

<p>“You were so late coming,” she said, “and the
sun was so warm, that I somehow lost myself for
a few moments. It is just as well you are late, as
the Sandpiper telephoned that his wife had a
seamstress this morning and so he could not get
here on time. You must wait here until you
hear him calling you from the beach.”</p>

<p>With these words the Field Mouse said “Good-bye,”
and scudded off through the long grass.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Ready</span> finished his dinner slowly,
stretched himself out in the grass, and
waited for the Sandpiper to appear. He was
quite near the beach now and knew, of course,
that the Sandpiper would take him along the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>How he hoped he would not have a long
wait! Life lately had been so full of waiting,
waiting, nothing but waiting!</p>

<p>He began to feel very sleepy, and then suddenly
he heard something laugh. It was not a
pleasant laugh&mdash;it was low and harsh, and disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Ready started up and found the queerest
creature gazing down at him. It looked something
like a bird, something like a bat, and not
unlike a rooster. It had dreadful colors on it,
reds and greens and queer purples which somehow
reminded you of all the unpleasant things
you had ever seen. When the creature laughed,
it reminded you of all the unpleasant things you
had ever heard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image096" style="width: 225px;">

</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“Nonsense,” snarled the creature</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“The Sandpiper won’t come,” it said
hoarsely. “The bats never sent him the message.
I’m a relative, and I guess I know.”</p>

<p>“But he promised,” said Ready.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” snarled the creature. “What’s
a bat’s promise worth? The Sandpiper will
never come, and as for you, you will go on and
on <i>and never get anywhere</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh!” said Ready, and then something
went crack, whack, thack!</p>

<p>He jumped up and looked about. Not a
thing was there. His bones ached, his tail felt
bent and queer, and his eyes were heavy.</p>

<p>“Why, I do believe I have been asleep,” he
said. “It’s all a dream, a kind of nightmare.
Although the sun is shining so brightly, I suppose
it should be called a <i>daymare</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>He arose, blinked, stretched his legs, and
shook himself to keep his heart from getting too
heavy. “The Sandpiper will come. The Sandpiper
will come,” he said.</p>

<p>Then he looked down the beach, and away
off in the distance he saw a little dark, moving
object. Then he heard a low, sweet call: “Peet
weet, peet weet.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Ready, with a joyful bark, “is
the Sandpiper.” And it was.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE JOURNEY WITH THE SANDPIPER</h3>
</div>

<p></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sandpiper arrived in about one more
minute. He made many apologies for
being late.</p>

<p>“You see, my wife has a seamstress to-day,”
he said. “They have been very busy making
over the children’s summer suits, and I have had
to do all the housework. The children play so
much in the little pool that they wear out their
clothes very quickly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandpiper was a very pleasant traveling
companion, although it must be said that he
had some queer habits. He would run along
the beach very rapidly and then stop for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
minutes and teeter while talking to Ready.
His voice was very sweet and low.</p>

<p>Ready greatly admired his neat and slender
body, his very neat and slender legs, and his
particularly neat and long slender bill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image100" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/image100.png" width="400" height="157" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Mr. Sandpiper</p>
</div>

<p>By this time Ready, having had so much
experience with so many different birds and
beasts, knew very well how to entertain them.
He asked Mr. Sandpiper quite naturally if he
had a comfortable home this year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Very comfortable indeed, thank you,” was
the reply. “It has the best lining we have ever
had.”</p>

<p>And then Mr. Sandpiper was off for a drink
in a pool near by. He flew above Ready in a
rather jerky fashion and at last alighted on a
little rock and commenced teetering again.</p>

<p>“Our nest is a little farther from the water
than usual,” he continued, and then was off
again for another drink. Indeed it was quite
difficult to follow him, either in movements or
conversation.</p>

<p>Things were going along pretty well, however,
when Mr. Sandpiper stopped short right
in the middle of a sentence and a teeter.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he said anxiously.</p>

<p>Ready listened but heard nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“There’s trouble at home. That’s my wife’s
danger call,” Mr. Sandpiper exclaimed. And
then Ready did hear a low, frightened, far-away
little peep.</p>

<p>Away flew Mr. Sandpiper in his queer jerky
fashion, while Ready followed him as rapidly
as he could. And then quite suddenly there
appeared the strangest sight that Ready had
ever seen.</p>

<p>Two boys were walking along the beach, and
in front of them on the sand lay Mrs. Sandpiper,
flopping about on one wing in a very pitiful
way. She would wait until the boys had almost
caught her before she would raise herself and
fly a little farther away from them. Then she
would flop again.</p>

<p>“She is not really hurt, you know,” whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Mr. Sandpiper, “but those dreadful boys
want to rob us of our home, and she is trying
to lead them away from it. I must fly over
and look after the children, who have probably
been told to hide under some leaves.”</p>

<p>He was off without another word and disappeared
behind a tall rock.</p>

<p>At first the boys thought it was great fun to
try to catch the Sandpiper, but after failing
to do it several times, they began to grow tired.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go away,” said one. “I believe
she is just trying to fool us. I have heard that
they do that sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I am sure the nest is near by,” said the
other boy. “I heard something over there.”</p>

<p>So the boys turned away from Mrs. Sandpiper
and went over toward the little rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Ready knew that something must be done,
or they would surely find the nest. Mrs. Sandpiper
gave a frightened little peep which said,
“Oh, please, please, somebody do something
to save my home and children.”</p>

<p>It took all Ready’s courage, but it must be
done. It was against his bringing up, against
his highest principles, against good taste in
dogs’ circles, but it <i>must be done</i>. He ran barking
at the two boys. He did not wait for them
to protect themselves with sticks and stones,
but growling and showing his teeth, he made
a spring towards them. The boys ran off, with
Ready close upon them. He must finish up
the work now and get them really out of the
way.</p>

<p>On and on ran the boys, on and on went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Ready, growling and barking savagely all the
time. You would have thought he was the
most snappy, vicious little dog in the world
if you had heard and seen him then, but all
the time he was running, his heart was growing
heavier and heavier.</p>

<p>Something seemed to be saying to him, “You
will lose the way, <i>go back, go back</i>.”</p>

<p>And then something else seemed to be answering,
“<i>But every dog must do his duty.</i>”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image105" style="width: 400px;">
  <img src="images/image105.png" width="400" height="157" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">On and on ran the boys, and on and on went Ready</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>At last they came to a rather rocky part of
the beach. There was one very high queerly
shaped rock, and the boys quickly climbed
over it and tried to hide behind it.</p>

<p>“Here is a good place to turn around,”
Ready decided. “I’ll pretend to have lost them
and run back now.”</p>

<p>But just as he turned and started on the
backward stretch, he felt a sharp stinging pain
in one of his legs. A horrid little sharp stone
had hit him, and then came another, almost
touching him.</p>

<p>The boys were now taking their revenge.</p>

<p>In spite of the sharp pain, Ready knew that
he must not linger here or let them see that
he had been hurt, so he ran bravely along, holding
his head proudly, never once letting those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
mean, cowardly boys know that anything was
the matter.</p>

<p>The pain began to grow very bad, and Ready
felt that he must stop somewhere soon. But
there was no sheltered spot in sight. The sunny
beach stretched out before him for miles and
miles.</p>

<p>At last he saw another Sandpiper taking a
drink in a tiny pool in one of the rocks. Ready
limped up to him and asked if he knew any
shady spot where he could rest for a few minutes.
You see, he knew Sandpiper language
very well by this time.</p>

<p>The Sandpiper, after jerking himself about,
remembered a nice little place behind a rock
about a quarter of a mile away. He guided
poor limping Ready to it, and then Ready told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
him all about his difficulties. The Sandpiper
was very much interested.</p>

<p>“I think I know your guide quite well,” he
said, “and I will fly back and tell him where you
are. He is a neighbor of mine. Hasn’t he a
particularly large black spot right in the middle
of his white shirt front?”</p>

<p>Wasn’t it splendid that Ready remembered
this very spot? He had noticed it during Mr.
Sandpiper’s first teeter. As you see, Ready was
really a very observant little dog.</p>

<p>After the Sandpiper had gone, and Ready
was left all alone with the pain, it felt very bad
indeed. Life seemed pretty hard. There was
always something unpleasant happening to
him.</p>

<p>He wondered if he would ever really reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
his journey’s end. Perhaps his leg would
grow worse and worse. He had heard of legs
that did do that. Perhaps&mdash;but just then from
right around the corner <i>a big shaggy brown
dog appeared</i>!</p>

<p>Ready was a great judge of dogs. Indeed,
he had been brought up with them, and one
look in this dog’s face told him that he had
found a friend. He was such a kind-eyed dog,
with understanding ears and tail. Ready knew
at once that this dog was years older than he,
and that he would know all about lame legs.</p>

<p>“You are suffering,” gently barked Shaggy
Dog.</p>

<p>At this Ready gave up and moaned out his
story. Shaggy Dog’s eyes grew kinder and
kinder. In a moment he had looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
poor leg and had made it much more comfortable
by a little licking. Then he had Ready
bathe it in a pool near by, and gave him the
best medicine in the world. Do you know
what it was? He gave him back his <i>courage</i>.</p>

<p>“Your leg will feel much better in a half
hour,” he said, “and you will be able to go along
easily. Your Sandpiper friend will soon be
here, and I will stay with you until he does
come.</p>

<p>“You have made a wonderful journey and
from what you tell me, I know you must be
nearly there. Be thankful that the very last
part of your journey you can take alone, for
then you need have no interruptions.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">“You are suffering,” gently barked Shaggy Dog</p>

<p>Ready was much comforted, and his leg began
to feel a great deal better. Shaggy Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
told Ready that he would gladly go with him
to the end of his journey, but his business, as
the oldest dog in the neighborhood, was to
carry dog messages and to look after things
generally all along the beach.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">Mr. and Mrs. Sandpiper and three of their children</p>
</div>

<p>This afternoon he was taking a special delivery
to a young collie some distance away.
It was a message from his grandfather to say
that he was coming that night to spend the
week-end. The young collie must know about
it this afternoon in order to get some special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
food ready for his grandfather, whose teeth and
digestion were very poor.</p>

<p>Then Shaggy Dog, seeing that Ready was
still a little nervous, recited some dog poetry
he had made. It went something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you have a lame leg,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You won’t have to beg.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forget the old stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And think of a bone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Instead of a moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, ‘Soon I’ll be home.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Do you know what happened? Ready was
asleep in a few minutes. When he awakened,
Shaggy Dog was smiling down at him and Mr.
and Mrs. Sandpiper, with three of the children,
were twittering above his head.</p>

<p>As soon as they saw that Ready was awake,
they flew toward him. Then Mother Sandpiper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
in a pretty little song, thanked him for
saving all the family from destruction. Father
Sandpiper joined in the last two lines, and at
a signal from their mother, the little Sandpipers
joined in the chorus.</p>

<p>It sounded to Ready something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Peet-weet, peet-weet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You deserve much meat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peet-weet, peet-weet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll soon be on your feet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After all the hand-shaking and good-byes
were over, Ready found out that his leg was
about well, and Mr. Sandpiper and he started
off again.</p>

<p>He hated to leave old Shaggy Dog, but had
to be satisfied with the promise of a visit from
him on the very first day of his vacation.</p>

<p>As they went along, Mr. Sandpiper explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
that he would have followed Ready
immediately if he had not found Mrs. Sandpiper
in hysterics, and it had taken some time
to quiet her. He said he was quite proud of
the children, who had stood motionless under
some tall weeds during the terrible danger.</p>

<p>At last Ready and Mr. Sandpiper came to
a place where a long straight road lay before
them. This was the place where the Sandpiper
had to leave him. He carefully explained how
easy it was to follow the road.</p>

<p>He said, “You remember that the Heron
was to go with you and show you a short cut
through the marshes. Perhaps it is just as well
for you that he had appendicitis, as he always
stops a long time to get his evening meal. Then
if he is startled he flies at once to a tree. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
he is rather apt to pick a quarrel. It is
thought by some of the best authorities in Birdland
that his appendicitis came from eating
too heartily one night and quarreling violently
afterwards.”</p>

<p>It was after twilight when the Sandpiper
finally said good-bye and left Ready alone on
the long dark road.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image116" style="width: 200px;">

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3 class="nobreak">THE END OF THE LONELY ROAD</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> had been no arrangement made
for Ready’s supper, as the Eagle had
expected him to be home by dark. At first
Ready was so relieved to be alone and have
no one to delay him, that he gave no thought
at all to supper.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to be free, to have no
animal or bird to entertain, to be able to go
on and on rapidly along a straight road.</p>

<p>But after a time, this going on and on grew
a little difficult. Thoughts of supper would
keep coming. Little side roads kept beckoning
to him and whispering, “This way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
food.” Then he commenced to feel the pain
in his leg, but did not dare to stop and rest for
fear he would be too lame to get up again.</p>

<p>So on through the darkness little Ready ran,
keeping his eyes straight before him, never
stopping a moment, so great was his fear of
losing his head or falling asleep.</p>

<p>“I must try to keep the courage that dear old
Shaggy Dog has given me,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Then there came to him these lines:</p>

<p>“Instead of a moan, say ‘Soon I’ll be home’.”
Much to his surprise he found himself adding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I shall keep on the run</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the journey is done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall not once stop</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until I just drop</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">On Master Dick’s bed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the small cottage red.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ready felt wonderfully proud of himself to
have made up this verse, and decided to have
it published some day in the <i>Dog Biscuit
Weekly</i>, which was considered the very best
dog magazine.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a rustle in the bushes,
and <i>an enormous black dog appeared</i>. He was
not a pleasant dog to look at or talk to. Any
dog of good standing could feel that at once.</p>

<p>He went up to Ready and said, “Come with
me, and your fortune is made.”</p>

<p>Ready did not even slow up as he answered
coldly, “I have no time to make my
fortune. I must get to my Master Dick to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>The black dog came nearer.</p>

<p>“Do not let such a chance go by,” he whispered.
“It means bones for months and liver
as long as you live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did he mention liver?” thought
Ready. He was so hungry and it was his
favorite food!</p>

<p>But something sang to Ready,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I shall keep on the run</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till my journey is done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So he turned sharply toward the black dog,
saying, as he ran:</p>

<p>“Go away at once. Do you suppose I would
let you keep me from seeing my master to-night?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I <i>make you come</i>?” said Black
Dog, in an ugly voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Ready looked at the Black Dog. He looked
at him from head to foot, and then, with a
growl, he made a step towards him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="image121" style="width: 375px;">
  <img src="images/image121.png" width="400" height="161" alt="" />
</div>
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">In spite of his large size he was a coward</p>
</div>

<p>Do you know what happened? The Black
Dog turned and ran away as fast as he could.
You see that in spite of his large size and big
voice, he was a coward. Many large-sized big-voiced
things are.</p>

<p>It was growing late now. Even the stars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
were getting sleepy, and Ready was the weariest
little dog in all the world.</p>

<p>He had come now to a village, and he began
to look anxiously for the red cottage with the
pine tree in front of it.</p>

<p>On and on he went, past brown houses, white
houses, green houses, past everything. Oh,
where was it? <i>Now there were no houses left.</i></p>

<p>Ready felt the tears coming to his eyes. He
had been looking so long and so eagerly; his
legs ached terribly. How could he keep on?
Then something sang to him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Instead of a moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bark, soon I’ll be home.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a sudden turn in the road and
there, right before him, it stood&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>THE RED HOUSE AND THE BIG PINE TREE!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>And yes, oh yes, there was a light in the window!
He had reached his journey’s end!</p>

<p>They were home! Ready suddenly felt very
strong and happy, and not at all tired. He
came softly up to the lighted window. There
sat Master Dick’s father and mother.</p>

<p>The father was saying, “How’s the little
fellow to-night?”</p>

<p>The mother answered, “He’s trying very hard
to be brave, but he can’t forget little Ready. Do
you know, he insists upon having the window
nearest the bed <i>always</i> open? Poor little fellow,
I fear that he cries himself to sleep after I leave
the room.”</p>

<p>Ready didn’t wait to hear another word, but
ran at once to that open window. In the dark
room lay a little boy with wet eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not being a soldier,” he was whispering
to himself, “but I can’t help it. Oh, Ready,
Ready, if I could just have you for a minute!”</p>

<p>Then there were three little barks, and a
waggy tail was on Master Dick’s nose.</p>

<p>There was a cry of joy from a little boy and a
bark of delight from a little dog.</p>

<p>Then a happy child’s voice was heard all
over the house calling, “<i>Mother, father, everybody,
READY’S COME BACK!</i>”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
